# Sudsy

## Intention
My intention with this project was to continue to push my web design skills. I created the iconography, colour scheme, prototype mock-ups and website by myself to get a better grasp of all the aspects of design.

## Description
Sudsy is a website for a fictional laundromat company. Some of the main concepts I dipped my toes into with this build were:

 - Colour scheme
 - Page anchors
 - SVG icond design and animation
 - Auto-adjusting ul grids
 - Integrated google maps
 - Using submission forms
